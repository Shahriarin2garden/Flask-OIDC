# Flask OIDC Provider

## 🔍 Understanding OpenID Connect (OIDC)

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, enabling client applications to verify the identity of end-users based on authentication performed by an authorization server. It also allows clients to obtain essential user profile information in a standardized and secure manner. OIDC has become the de facto standard for implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) in modern authentication systems and is a cornerstone for building secure web and mobile applications.

OIDC enhances OAuth 2.0 by adding an ID token, which is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains claims about the authentication event and the authenticated user. These features make it ideal for federated identity scenarios, allowing seamless login experiences across platforms and services.

### 📊 OIDC Authorization Code Flow with PKCE

1. **Client Registration**: The client application registers itself with the OIDC provider and is issued a `client_id` and `client_secret` (or is marked as a public client in some cases).

2. **Authorization Request**: The client redirects the user to the `/authorize` endpoint, including parameters such as `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `scope`, `state`, and a PKCE `code_challenge`.

3. **User Authentication**: The user is presented with a login interface to authenticate using their credentials.

4. **User Consent**: After successful authentication, the user is prompted to consent to the application's access request for specific scopes.

5. **Authorization Code Issuance**: The authorization server redirects the user back to the client with an authorization code.

6. **Token Request**: The client sends a request to the `/token` endpoint, including the received authorization code and the PKCE `code_verifier`.

7. **Token Response**: The provider responds with an ID token (for authentication), an access token (for resource access), and optionally a refresh token (for long-lived sessions).

8. **UserInfo Access**: Using the access token, the client fetches user profile details from the `/userinfo` endpoint.

9. **Token Introspection or Revocation**: The client can introspect or revoke tokens using provider-specific endpoints to maintain token integrity and control.

The ID token, structured as a signed JWT, contains identity claims such as user ID (`sub`), authentication timestamp, and issuer metadata. These tokens are signed using RS256, allowing relying parties to validate token integrity and confirm the issuer. This provides a robust and interoperable mechanism for cross-domain authentication.

## 🧭 Project Overview

**Flask OIDC Provider** is a modular, lightweight, and standards-compliant implementation of an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider built on Flask. It supports secure authentication flows, token issuance, user profile delivery, and token lifecycle management for web and API clients. Built with extensibility in mind, the project supports multiple OAuth2/OIDC extensions and deployment configurations.

Key features include:

* Complete OIDC Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for public clients
* Refresh token support and automatic expiration handling
* Support for dynamic client registration as per OIDC standards
* Secure token revocation and introspection endpoints
* Public key delivery via JWKS endpoint and metadata discovery
* Custom claims in ID tokens and UserInfo responses
* Compatibility with frontend SPAs and backend services

This project is suitable for internal authentication gateways, microservice SSO providers, proof-of-concept apps, and education on OAuth2/OIDC systems.

## 📡 REST API Usage Examples

Quick examples using `curl` and Python’s `requests` to perform core OIDC operations, along with sample API responses to illustrate the expected output.

### Dynamic Client Registration

```bash
curl -X POST https://auth.example.com/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "client_name": "my-spa-app",
    "redirect_uris": ["https://app.example.com/callback"],
    "grant_types": ["authorization_code"],
    "response_types": ["code"],
    "scope": "openid profile email"
}'
```

### Auth Code Flow (with PKCE)

**Step 1: Generate code verifier and challenge**

```bash
code_verifier=$(openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '=+/')
code_challenge=$(echo -n "$code_verifier" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl base64 | tr -d '=+/')
```

**Step 2: Redirect User to Authorize Endpoint**

```text
GET https://auth.example.com/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=https://app.example.com/callback&scope=openid+profile+email&code_challenge=$code_challenge&code_challenge_method=S256&state=XYZ
```

**Step 3: Exchange Code for Tokens**

```bash
curl -X POST https://auth.example.com/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&code=$AUTH_CODE&redirect_uri=https://app.example.com/callback&code_verifier=$code_verifier'
```

**Python Example**

```python
import requests
response = requests.post('https://auth.example.com/token', data={
    'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
    'client_id': 'CLIENT_ID',
    'code': 'AUTH_CODE',
    'redirect_uri': 'https://app.example.com/callback',
    'code_verifier': 'CODE_VERIFIER'
})
print(response.json())
```
